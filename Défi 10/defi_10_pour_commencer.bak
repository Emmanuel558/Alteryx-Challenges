          <Text><![CDATA[Les jeux vidéo font maintenant partie de la culture populaire. Cette forme de divertissement a commencé avec des consoles géantes qui ont été miniaturisées pour une utilisation à la maison. Au fur et à mesure que leur popularité augmentait et que la technologie évoluait, de nouveaux de jeux étaient proposés par de nombreuses compagnies. 

De la grenouille sautillant dans la rue jusqu’à sa maison, aux formes étranges tombant du ciel à empiler ou d’envahisseurs venus de l’espace (Space Invaders) à vaincre, il y avait un jeu pour vous.

Au fil du temps, les entreprises ont innové, créant ou améliorant différentes catégories de jeux ou inventant de nouveaux genres. Ces jeux ont été mis à disposition sur diverses de plateformes.

Le défi de cette semaine est de fractionner un ensemble de données de jeux vidéo en colonnes.
